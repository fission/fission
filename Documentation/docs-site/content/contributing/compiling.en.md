[You only need to do this if you're making Fission changes; if you're
just deploying Fission, use fission.yaml which points to prebuilt
images.]

You'll need the `go` compiler and tools installed, along with the
[glide dependency management
tool](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide#install).  You'll also need
docker for building images.

The server side is compiled as one binary ("fission-bundle") which
contains controller, poolmgr and router; it invokes the right one
based on command-line arguments.

To build fission-bundle: clone this repo to
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/fission/fission`, then from the top level
directory (if you want to build the image with the docker inside
minikube, you'll need to set the proper environment variables with
`eval $(minikube docker-env)`):

```
  # Get dependencies
  $ glide install

  # Build fission server and an image
  $ pushd fission-bundle
  $ ./build.sh
```

You now need to build the docker image for fission. You can use
`push.sh` and push it to a docker hub account. But it's easiest to use
minikube and its built-in docker daemon:

```
  $ eval $(minikube docker-env)
  $ docker build -t minikube/fission-bundle .
```

Next, install fission with this image on your kubernetes cluster using the helm chart:

```
  $ helm install --set "image=minikube/fission-bundle,pullPolicy=IfNotPresent,analytics=false" charts/fission-all
```

And if you're changing the CLI too, you can build it with:

```
  # Build Fission CLI
  $ cd fission && go install
```
