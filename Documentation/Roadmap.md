# Fission Roadmap

## Function features ([area-func](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-func))

- Secrets, configmaps, env vars
- Volumes
- Mem requests and limits
- Function exec time deadline
- Expose a regular K8s Service for a function

## Fission API ([area-api](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-api))

- CRD-based controller
- API authentication
- Aggregated API server

## Development Workflows ([area-dev](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-dev))

- Function Versioning
- Versioning for a group of functions
- Rolling upgrades
  - for one function
  - for multiple functions
  - for functions + other kubernetes deployments
- Unit testing

## API Gateway / Ingress features ([area-ingress](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-ingress))

- Function authn hooks
- K8s Ingress flag
- Bundle an ingress controller?

## Workflows and Function composition ([area-composition](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-composition))

- Simple Composition - Sync
- Simple Composition - Async
- Hooks (pre, post, on-error)
- Workflows
- Testing in the presence of function composition

## Events ([area-events](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-events))

- NATS
- Kafka
- AWS: SNS, SQS
- Google PubSub
- RabbitMQ
- Other event sources

- Bundle an event queue (NATS streaming, most probably)

## Operability ([area-ops](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-ops))

### Fission Install/Upgrade ([area-install](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-install))

- Helm Installer for Fission
- Helm installation for fission functions
- CLI installer/upgrader? ("fission upgrade")
- Upgrade checker/reminder (like minikube does)
- CLI auto-upgrader

### Function observation ([area-observe](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-observe))

- Function Logging
- Tracing -- Opentracing
- Metrics -- Prometheus
- Function exception tracking
- Logging function load errors
- Tracing fission overheads for each function

## Function Security

- Function isolation (is authz hook sufficient or do we need something like mutual TLS?)
- Function service accounts

## UX, especially for beginners ([area-ux](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-ux))

- Fission CLI should include a tutorial
- Fission CLI should have a way to drop you into the UI
- Eliminate FISSION_URL, just use kube client to find fission url. Also useful to grab credentials.

## Documentation ([area-doc](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-doc))

- Installation guide improvements
- Troubleshooting guide for common problems
- FAQ
- Performance overview
- Render docs nicely to fission.io

## Web UI (tracked separately in the fission-ui repo)

## Performance and Scalability ([area-perf](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-perf))

- Autoscaling
- Cold-start optimization -- optimistically choose from pool, save about ~20msec
- Cold-start optimization -- preload funcs in fetcher
- Cold-start optimization -- preload libraries in envs (v2) -- mem vs. speed tradeoff

## Function extensibility ([area-ext](https://github.com/fission/fission/labels/area-ext))

- Env v2: easy addition of dependencies etc.
- Integration with Service Broker

## Multi-area stuff

- Execution strategies: cold-start pool vs create-pod-on-cold-start -- one size doesn't fit all, at least with current tech; abstract over execution strategies according to requirements
