# Simple test of recorder updates
# 0) Setup: One recorder created for function with trigger
# 1) Recorder disabled, cURL request made, check not saved.
# 2) Recorder re-enabled, request repeated, check now saved.
# 3) New trigger created for same function recorded w/ different url, recorder updated to observe requests for this trigger
#    Request repeated at new url, check saved.
