Check that the build is green!
------------------------------

Fix the build if it is not green. DON'T proceed unless build is GREEN!


Updating Fission Repo (https://github.com/fission/fission)
------------------------------

1. cd to the top of the fission repo, create a branch:

   git checkout -b vX.Y.Z

2. Change references of old version to new version in charts directory. You use replace and find all with a quick preview in your IDE.

3. Run

   `./hack/release.sh <VERSION>`

   This script checks to make sure you're releasing from the vX.Y.Z
   branch, and that your repo is clean (no modified/staged files).

   This will take a while as it builds and pushes all images (Approx ~2-3 hours)

4. After the build is successful, the charts will be in build/charts directory from root of Fission. Move these charts to fission/fission-charts repo. We will push them shortly after some changes to repo.

5. As part of release script, changelog.md has been modified. Take a look at it, correct it if you want and then commit it, discard other directories etc. produced by builders after inspection.

6. Now push this vx.y.z branch to remote repo. Create a PR and merge it into master branch. 

a. Test build from master branch for sanity check
b. Make sure the master build is green

7. 

Updating Fission Charts (https://github.com/fission/fission-charts)
------------------------------
a. Switch to fission/fission-charts repo and run `index.sh` in that repo.  (Don't edit the index.yaml in this repo manually.  index.sh generates it, using the helm repo CLI.)

b. You should have index.yaml and fission-core-*, fission-all-* charts as change, add, commit and push it to repo.


8. Go to Github Web UI --> Releases, here you will notice a pre-release for the version x.y.z you just created. 

Edit it and add links to:

   * Install guide in docs
   * Changelog.md

Before you save the release - UNCHECK the "This is a pre-release" checkbox. This mark the release as ready for consumption (If release is stable).

Updating Fission Docs (https://github.com/fission/docs.fission.io)
------------------------------

9. Documentatin Update 

a. Merge documentation PRs that are peer reviewed and get latest master locally.

b. In the repo fission/docs.fission.io change version in version.sh file to latest version (x.y.z) and run build.sh script

c. ** ONLY ** in the dist/x.y.z directory i.e. current version directory - replace all references from previous release to current release. Please use your IDE as there will be thousands of references.

d.VERIFY: There should be changes only in dist/x.y.z - where x.y.z is current version and in following files:

- dist/_redirects
- dist/index.html
- version.sh
