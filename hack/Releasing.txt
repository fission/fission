Prerequisites
-------------

1. Get a dockerhub account if you don't have one.  Ask to be added to
   the fission dockerhub account.

2. Get a Github "personal access token":
   https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

   Save the token to ~/.gh-access-token (make sure that the file is
   readable only by you)

3. Go toolchain set up.

   The ability to build docker images.

   `docker login`



Update versions
---------------

Update the version in the source code, helm charts and docs.

In the sources, the version is present in both CLI and controller:
   fission/main.go
   controller/api.go

In each charts, the version is in Chart.yaml, values.yaml and
templates/NOTES.yaml.

Commit your changes, push them, open a PR, wait for someone to merge
it (or merge it yourself).


Make the release
----------------

1. cd to the top of the repo and run

   ./hack/release.sh <VERSION>

   This script checks to make sure you're releasing from the master
   branch, and that your repo is clean (no modified/staged files).

   This will take a while.

2. Generate docs, copy to the right place, push to github

3. Copy over charts, update helm chart index, push to github

4. Manually test one installation, switch from pre-release to release.
