--------------

Fission is a fast serverless framework for Kubernetes with a focus on
developer productivity and high performance.

Fission operates on _just the code_: Docker and Kubernetes are
abstracted away under normal operation, though you can use both to
extend Fission if you want to.

Fission is extensible to any language; the core is written in Go, and
language-specific parts are isolated in something called
_environments_ (more below).  Fission currently supports NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Go, 
PHP, Bash, and any Linux executable, with more languages coming soon.

## Performance: 100msec cold start

Fission maintains a pool of "warm" containers that each contain a
small dynamic loader.  When a function is first called,
i.e. "cold-started", a running container is chosen and the function is
loaded.  This pool is what makes Fission fast: cold-start latencies
are typically about 100msec.

## Kubernetes is the right place for Serverless

We're built on Kubernetes because we think any non-trivial app will
use a combination of serverless functions and more conventional
microservices, and Kubernetes is a great framework to bring these
together seamlessly.

Building on Kubernetes also means that anything you do for operations
on your Kubernetes cluster &mdash; such as monitoring or log
aggregation &mdash; also helps with ops on your Fission deployment.

## Getting Started

```bash
  # Add the stock NodeJS env to your Fission deployment
  $ fission env create --name nodejs --image fission/node-env

  # Create a function with a javascript one-liner that prints "hello world"
  $ fission function create --name hello --env nodejs --code https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fission/examples/master/nodejs/hello.js

  # Run the function.  This takes about 100msec the first time.
  $ fission function test --name hello
  Hello, world!
```
