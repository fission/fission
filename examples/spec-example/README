This is the root directory of a sample fission "app".  The app contains source code for
one function (hello world) in the hello/hello.py file.

The `specs` directory contains YAML files that specify a fission environment, and a
python function.

You can create this app on your cluster by running `fission spec apply` from this
directory.  See `fission spec --help` for other options.

After applying the spec, you can test the function with `fission fn test --name hello`.
