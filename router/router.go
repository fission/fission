This is the Fission Router package.

Its job is to:

  1. Keep track of HTTP triggers and their mappings to functions

     Use the controller API to get and watch this state.

  2. Given a function, get a reference to a routable function run service

     Use the ContainerPoolManager API to get a service backed by one
     or more function run containers.  The container(s) backing the
     service may be newly created, or they might be reused.  The only
     requirement is that one or more containers backs the service.

  3. Forward the request to the service, and send the response back.

     Plain ol HTTP.
