# InfluxDB Container Image

Due to tutum/influxdb dockerhub repo is no longer exists and causes installation failure, we decide to fork the original 
source repository to rebuild influxDB image so that users can change the image repo while keeping backward compatibility.

The files and code changes are based on [tutumcloud/influxdb](https://github.com/tutumcloud/influxdb) source repository.
All credits belongs to them and thanks for their hard work!

## UPDATE 2018/10/30
* Update InfluxDB version from 1.0.0 to 1.6.4
