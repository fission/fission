// InvokeStrategy is a set of controls over how the function executes.
// It affects the performance and resource usage of the function.

// An InvokeStrategy is of one of two types: ExecutionStrategy, which controls low-level
// parameters such as which ExecutorType to use, when to autoscale, minimum and maximum
// number of running instances, etc. A higher-level AbstractInvokeStrategy will also be
// supported; this strategy would specify the target request rate of the function,
// the target latency statistics, and the target cost (in terms of compute resources).
