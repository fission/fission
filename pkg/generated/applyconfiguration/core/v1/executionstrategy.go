// with apply.

// ExecutionStrategy specifies low-level parameters for function execution,
// such as the number of instances.
//
// MinScale affects the cold start behavior for a function. If MinScale is 0 then the
// deployment is created on first invocation of function and is good for requests of
// asynchronous nature. If MinScale is greater than 0 then MinScale number of pods are
// created at the time of creation of function. This ensures faster response during first
// invocation at the cost of consuming resources.
//
// MaxScale is the maximum number of pods that function will scale to based on TargetCPUPercent
// and resources allocated to the function pod.
