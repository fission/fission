# Contributing to Fission

### Thank you!

Thank you for taking the time and effort to contribute to Fission!

First, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  By
participating, you're expected to uphold this code.

### Choose something to work on

The easiest way to start is to look at existing
[issues](https://github.com/fission/fission/issues) and see if there's
something there that you'd like to work on.

Also, if you're familiar with a language that we don't support today,
adding an environment for a new language is a good task to take on.
Take a look at the Python environment as an example.

If you're interested in working on something that doesn't have an
existing issue, feel free to file a new one.

There's plenty of stuff to do.  If you need help choosing something to
work on, we'll be happy to suggest something depending on your
interests.

### Talk to people

At any point, from thinking about contributing to merging your
changes, please feel free to reach out to us!  We're more than happy
to talk.

If you choose a big chunk of work that involves design changes to
Fission, please talk to us while planning the change; that way we can
all be on the same page before you invest too much work into it.
