  resource:

executor:
  adoptExistingResources: false
  podReadyTimeout: 300s

## Router config
router:
  deployAsDaemonSet: false
  svcAddressMaxRetries: 5
  svcAddressUpdateTimeout: 30s
  unTapServiceTimeout: 3600s
  ## Display endpoint access logs
  ## To be aware of enabling logging endpoint access log, it increases
  ## router resource utilization when under heavy workloads.
  displayAccessLog: false

  ## Add annotations for router
  # svcAnnotations:
  #   cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: Internal

  ## For router to match encoded path.
  ## If true, "/foo%2Fbar" will match the path "/{var}";
  ## Otherwise, it will match the path "/foo/bar".
  useEncodedPath: false

  roundTrip:
    ## If true, router will disable the HTTP keep-alive which result in performance degradation.
    ## But it ensures that router can redirect new coming requests to new function pods.
    ##
    ## If false, router will enable transport keep-alive feature for better performance.
    ## However, the drawback is it takes longer to switch to newly created function pods
    ## if using newdeploy as executor type for function. If you want to preserve the
    ## performance while keeping the short switching time to new function, you can create
    ## an environment with short grace period by setting flag "--graceperiod" (default 360s),
    ## so that kubernetes will be able to reap old function pod quickly.
    ##
    ## For details, see https://github.com/fission/fission/issues/723
    disableKeepAlive: true

    ## The keep-alive period for an active network connection to function pod.
    keepAliveTime: 30s

    ## HTTP transport request timeout
    timeout: 50ms

    ## The length of request timeout will multiply with timeoutExponent after each retry
    timeoutExponent: 2

    ## Max retries times of a failed request
    maxRetries: 10

  ## Sample with a rate per time window (traces/second)
  traceSamplingRate: 0.5

## Persist data to a persistent volume.
persistence:
  ## If true, fission will create/use a Persistent Volume Claim unless storageType is set to s3
  ## If false, use emptyDir
  ##
  enabled: true

  ## Must be set to either local or S3.
  ## If storateType is set(other than local), one of its backend configuration must be set as below.
  #storageType: local | s3

  ## Sample configruation for AWS s3 storage backend
  #s3:
  # bucketName: <awsBucketName>
  # subDir: <sub directory within a bucket>
  # accessKeyId: <awsAccessKeyId>
  # secretAccessKey: <awsSecretAccessKey>
  # region: <awsRegion>

  ## A manually managed Persistent Volume Claim name
  ## Requires persistence.enabled: true
  ## If defined, PVC must be created manually before volume will be bound
  ##
  # existingClaim:

  ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
  ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
  ## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
  ##   set, choosing the default provisioner. (gp2 on AWS, standard on
  ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)
  ##
  # storageClass: "-"

  accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
  size: 8Gi

## Extend the container specs for the core fission pods.
## Can be used to add things like affinty/tolerations/nodeSelectors/etc.
## For example:
## extraCoreComponentPodConfig:
##   affinity:
##     nodeAffinity:
##       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
##         nodeSelectorTerms:
##           - matchExpressions:
##             - key: capability
##               operator: In
##               values:
##                 - app
#extraCoreComponentPodConfig:
#  affinity:
#  tolerations:
#  nodeSelector:

## Analytics let us count how many people installed fission. Set to
## false to disable analytics.
analytics: true

## Internally used for generating an analytics job for non-helm installs
analyticsNonHelmInstall: false

## Archive pruner is a garbage collector for archives on the fission storage service.
## This interval configures the frequency at which it runs inside the storagesvc pod.
## The value is in minutes.
pruneInterval: 60

## Fission pre-install/pre-upgrade checks live in this image
preUpgradeChecksImage: fission/pre-upgrade-checks

## if there are any pod specialization errors when a function is triggered and this flag is set to true, the error
## summary is returned as part of http response
debugEnv: false

## Prometheus for scrapping service metrics
prometheus:
  ## set this flag to true if prometheus needs to be deployed along with fission
  enabled: false

  ## If enabled is false, please assign the prometheus service URL
  ## that is accessible by components.
  serviceEndpoint: ""

## set this flag to false if you dont need canary deployment feature
canaryDeployment:
  enabled: false

# Use these flags to enable opentracing, the variable is endpoint of Jaeger collector in the format shown below
